## Background
Tree size has been shown to influence fruit yeild in citrus. This preliminary study tracks orange tree circumference over four years for future correlation to fruit yeild.

## Orange Growth data
```{r}
summary(Orange)
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(Orange, aes(age, circumference, color=Tree))
p + geom_jitter() 
```
